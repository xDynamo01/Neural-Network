# Neural Network from Scratch 🧠

This repository contains my implementation of a neural network from scratch in Python, inspired by the book **"Neural Networks from Scratch" (NNFS)** by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukieła.

## 📌 Goal
The main goal of this project is to **understand the mathematical and computational foundations of neural networks** without relying on frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch — only Python and basic libraries like `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

## 🚀 Progress
- [x] First neuron (simple dense layer)  
- [ ] Multiple neurons implementation  
- [ ] Activation functions  
- [ ] Full forward pass  
- [ ] Backpropagation  
- [ ] Training on a real dataset  

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python 3.10+**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization later)
